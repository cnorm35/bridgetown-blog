Here is some stuff I'm going to talk about.

I’ve really been wanting to publish a course for some time now.  I’ve never really had a single subject that I felt would be a good fit for me….until now.

Lately, I’ve been doing quite a bit of stuff around Action Mailbox.  I have a couple of blog posts, an upcoming Rails conf talk and have had a chance to speak at a couple of meetups on the topic.

I’m excited to announce that a waitlist is now available for the course.  I plan on creating a course covering Action Mailbox details as well as a lot of practical examples for ways you may want to process inbound emails.

Each section will include focused and short text and video lessons.  The advanced sections and hands-on sections will be separate so you can skip or revisit the details as you need it.

The hands-on sections will cover some real world and practical use cases (maybe impractical too)

I’m hoping to have the course completed sometime this summer.  I should have a better idea of the dates after some sample videos and chapters are made available for feedback.

The idea is to record an intro lesson people can preview to make sure things like lighting, sound, screen resolution, etc are all in order before moving forward. I don’t want to record the whole course only to find out the sound is off or something else is wrong.

Joining the waitlist will give you the chance to preview the example videos.
