This is the start of the post

Goofy openers and lines:

You can't spell beard without read

Jokes on you, this was the perfect writing exercise to get me going again, plus I actually have some beard tips

Let the beard tips rips

Far be it for me to deny the people what they want

Don’t tempt me with a good time

Think the recipie was something like this 

1 ounce jojoba oil
1/2 ounce avocado oil
1/4 ounce almond oil
1/4 ounce apricot oil
16–20 drops Texas Cedarwood essential oil
7 drops orange essential oil

Get a nice beard comb made for beards
Get some nice scissors.
Clippers can be helpful but optional

Don't use harsh shampoos striping the oil away

Washing too often can leave skin dry, scratchy and itchy.
