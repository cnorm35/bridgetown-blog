If it seems like there’s been a resurgence in regional ruby conferences, it’s because there has been.  It’s been great seeing these type of events start coming back to life.  Smaller regional conferences were always a favorite of mine.  It’s feels like a much more relaxed pace, in a good way, and with a smaller group of attendees, it’s much easier to have repeat conversations with people and really get a chance to get to know one another. These smaller regional conferences are usually more affordable enticing people to their first conference.

Blue Ridge Ruby is a new regional conference in Asheville, NC and is a wonderful example of exactly why I love regional ruby conferences.  I had a chance to meet Jermey Smith, one of the organizers at Rails SaaS last year and remember seeing him tweet out the first inklings of a conference idea (and was already calling it Blue Ridge Ruby) so it was great to see this materialze the way it has. I’ve also never followed a conference from inception to the first one so that was a great thing to see unfold.

I grew up in a small town in North Western NC nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountains.  My first ‘job’ also happened to be in my Grandfather’s antique shop right off the Blue Ridge parkway so seeing ‘Blue Ridge’ and ‘Ruby’ made me instantly identity and latch on to the conference.

Location

The conference venue was located within a theatre in an old Masoic temple.  Walking up the creepy and old stairs, you walk past a number of portraits of old members of the lodge from the 1800s.  They were delightful creepy and was waiting for one to whisper in my ear as I huffed up the stairs.

The main floor of the conference was a great setup.  The theater area had a wonderful woodsy backdrop that was a great way to set the mood for some ruby in the mountains.

There was also a balcony section with a little more room to spread out.

Outside of the main area for the talks, there was a common area decked out with local fresh coffee, cold brew, and plenty of snacks and beverages throughout the day.  There was also a great little outdoor area with a refreshing breeze blowing through most of the time.  The humidity in the south, even the mountains always takes me a bit to adjust to.

To summon the attendees back to the main hall, there was a real gong place in the hallway and… bonged? Is that what you call ringing a gong?  Anyway, one of the organizers had a gong connect and was able to make it happen.

The venue was also only about a block or two from the two suggested hotels and had a great selection of local restaurants.  Having a 2 hour lunch break made it a lot easier to explore some of the local faire.

One the second day, after dropping off my conference shirt at my hotel during lunch, I was walking back and saw one of those signs right off exit ramps saying there was a Bojangles close by.  Since my departing flight from CO was 7 hours late, I wasn’t able to swing by when I was planning to.  I let the sweet siren’s song of cajun filet biscuits lure me like some unknowing sailor and made a U-turn.  The organizers did a great job with making sure everyone were aware of the social and lunch plans in slack.  I didn’t want to dupe someone into heading to a fast food chicken and biscuits joint.  


Speakers

There was a great lineup of speakers. There was a good spread of talks covering some different topics that are interesting to a ruby audience.

I enjoyed all the talks and was one of the few times where I attended every talk.  I think this is related to the 30 min breaks between talks and 2 hrs for lunch.  I didn’t feel like I had to duck out and recharge for a bit so that was a great part of the conference.

In addition to all of the scheduled speakers, there were a handful of 5 minute lightning talks people could sign up for the first day.


Amenities

There are a ton of great food and dining options in Asheville and especially beer options.  The happy hour the first day of the conference was at a lovely little cocktail bar ran by one of the attendees and had a few conference themed drinks available.

A good portion of the rest of the time was spent either at the boardgame cafe / bar with the happy hour hosted by Wafris and JudoScale (thanks Mike and Adam! - add links and confirm) or hanging out on one of the patios for one of the local breweries.  They seemed to have the most space available to accommodate larger groups so was a good place to congregate towards the end of the evening.


Being summertime in the mountains, it was a great addition to add some options for weekend activities with hiking and tubing. I think there was originally an option to tour Biltmore but don’t think there was a lot of interest in that.  With the number of local attendees, pretty much every kid within a 3hr drive of Asheville has take a field trip there at least once.  Despite it being used for the exterior shots of Richie Rich, it never happened.

Unfortunately, I missed out on these and headed up the mountains to spend a few days visiting my hometown about 2 hrs away.


Conference Travel and Work Survival Kit

So, saying this is a survival kit is probably overkill.  Having recently made a trip to the east coast for Rails conf, I had a few things I wanted to bring to make things easier.  I was planning on working 2 of the days from home and having a few things with me makes me much more productive and comfortable.  Between all of this, plus some fishing gear crammed into my suitcase, I was 48 of my allotted 50 lbs for my luggage

Conference Stuff
Ear Plugs, Night mask, battery packs, cords and adapters, aspirin, kindle, small notebook (great for keeping stickers unbent and coffee setup.

I typically don’t sleep well while traveling and anything I can do to squeeze out better rest is worth it to me.

Coffee Setup
Travel Kettle
Old ass aeropress with metal mesh grinder
Hand crank burr grinder
Whole bean coffee
Camping coffee mug

Albiet a little precarious to pour almost boiling water (at my resident altitude, water boils at 194F/90 C which is just about perfect for coffee so I poured too soon and burnt the first run, but still much better than the keruig who was last cleaned god knows when) into the tiny hole of the upside down aeropress (if you haven’t tried it, here’s what it is) from a not solid kettle, this whole setup worked surprisingly well and made for a nice leisurely morning in my room before heading to the conference for the day.  This also kept me from having to drink pre-ground Folgers while I was at home.  I’m too old to drink terrible coffee unles the alternative is no coffee so I’m not going back.  This whole setup actually worked pretty well and will be using it again in the future.

Work Stuff

The M2 Air has been amazing.  I did a whole day at a coworking space, complete with about 2hrs of video calls, streaming and running my dev environment all day and was left with about 50% towards the end of the day, it’s wild

Audio Technica ATX-50s.  I love these headphones and have been using them almost daily for 9 years now, I brought a 1m (or whatever) cable along for the trip since it seemed like it would work, and while it worked, with the setup I was using, I wish it was a bit longer.

The roost stand performed great.  It was a little expensive but rock solid providing multiple angles and really portable when it’s collapsed.

Ergodox EZ with silent cherry brown switches.  I recently swapped the switches for something that wouldn’t be as obnoxious in public and these have been great.  I could probably reduce the noise even more by adding some o-rings. After scouring amazon, I was able to find a case with the correct dimensions to make transporting the ergodox a lot easier.

MX Ergo trackball.  This is the only thing I plan on changing.  It was great having something ergonomic but it’s pretty bulky.  I ordered a case for the mouse before leaving, but that was one item that never showed up.  It stopped working shortly after getting back home and wouldn’t be surprised if it was related to being stuck in my checked luggage for 2 flights. While I was waiting on a replacement, I borrowed my wife’s magic trackpad and think this is a much better option and will be using something like this over toting around my trackball (just got the same one with more tilt)
