with Postmark."

In my recent [Action Mailbox Post](/ruby/action_mailbox), I reviewed a ton of
information on how Action Mailbox works and how you can use it.  One very
important topic I didn't go over was how to deploy your Action Mailbox code to
one of the default providers from Rails.

With that post covering a lot of detail, I wanted to separate out the
instructions for deploying.

Rails provides a few different options for providers to handle your inbound
emails.  You'll see these referred to as `Ingresses` or `Ingress` when referring
to one.

The default options from Rails are

- Exim
- Mailgun
- Mandrill
- Postfix
- Postmark
- Qmail
- SendGrid

I've used Postmark quite a bit over the years for transactional email and have
always had a good experience. It's my default provider and the one we're
going to walk through in this post.

Before we get started, there are a couple of things you'll need that will help
your setup go smoother.

- A Postmark Account
- A domain to use for the mailer _or_ a secure tunnel to your localhost like
  ngrok.

This post will assume your app is already deployed somewhere and won't be
covering deploying your Rails app.  We're only focusing on connecting Postmark for your inbound
emails.

If you're looking for some help deploying your app, I've been a long
time customer of [Hatchbox](https://hatchbox.io/){:target="_blank"} and can't recommend them enough.

With your Action Mailbox app ready to go, let's start adding the configuration
needed for Postmark.

[Rails Guide -
Postmark](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailbox_basics.html#postmark){:target="_blank"}

There isn't a lot of code required for the Postmark setup so we can add some of
the required code before configuring our mail servers in Postmark.

The first thing we need to is set our ingress for Action Mailbox in `config/environments/production.rb`


#### Setting the Ingress

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
config.action_mailbox.ingress = :postmark
```

#### Generating and setting the ingress password

We also need to generate a password and set that value in our encrypted
credentials or as an environment variable.

In your Rails console, we can use `SecureRandom` to generate a password for us.

```ruby
SecureRandom.alphanumeric
=> "12312ddfgdfg"
```


**Encrypted Credentials Side Note**


Running `bin/rails credentials:edit` will open the main encrypted credentials file. All the credentials in this file will apply to _all_ environments unless we have a specific environment file.

**note:** For VSCode you may need to run `EDITOR="code --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit`.  If your using another editor besides VSCode and are seeing issues getting your encrypted credentials to open, swap `EDITOR=code` with whatever editor your using `EDITOR=sublime`


<!-- VS Code credentials edit -->
<!-- `EDITOR="code --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit` -->

In other words, these credentials are going to apply to our `development` and
`production` environment unless I created a `credentials/development.yml` (or
whatever that is) file.  Eventually you'll probably want to separate that out
with different settings for different environments.  However, making the
password available in our `development` environment is going to make it easier
connecting this to our local environment with ngrok.

#### Add generated password to encrypted credentials

Now we're done detouring into Rails encrypted credentials, we can the password
we generated earlier to our credentials.

You'll need to copy the output of that command and add it to our encrypted
credentials.

I'm a huge fan of using Rails encrypted credentials but if you'd like to stick
with using environment variables, you can use the `RAILS_INBOUND_EMAIL_PASSWORD` environment variable for your password.

Once your encrypted credentials are open add the following code with your
generated password.

```ruby
action_mailbox:
  ingress_password: 12312ddfgdfg
```

That's pretty much it for the code changes we need to make.  The rest of the
setup and configuration is going to be on Postmark.

#### Creating A Postmark Server

If you haven't already, create a new Postmark account and create a new 'Server'

In Postmark, a server is a way to organize or group incoming or outgoing email.
You can read more about [Postmark Servers](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/user-guide/managing-your-account/managing-servers){:target="_blank"}

<div class="my-5">
<img
    alt="Postmark Server Setup"
    class="position-relative mx-auto rounded w-100 shadow-lg"
    src="/images/PostmarkServerSetup.png"
    style="z-index: 10"
/>
</div>

After creating the server, you'll see 3 different 'Streams' listed on the
dashboard.

To try to keep things consistent.  I'll be using the same terminology as
Postmark does.  A server is contains different types of 'Streams' which are used
to send different types of email. Here's how Postmark defines Streams:

<blockquote>
    <cite>
      Message Streams is how we separate different types of mail to ensure the highest deliverability for each. Pick the one thatâ€™s right for your email:
    </cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <cite>
      Transactional streams are for sending time-sensitive messages triggered for one recipient at a time.
      Broadcasts are for messages sent to many recipients at once, like marketing campaigns or newsletters.
      Inbound stream is a way for your application to receive email.
    </cite>
</blockquote>

Your new Postmark server should have 3 different streams.

- Default Broadcast Stream (marketing emails)
- Default Inbound Stream (inbound email)
- Default Transactional Stream (transactional email from your app like password
  reset emails)

<div class="my-5">
<img
    alt="Postmark Default Streams"
    class="position-relative mx-auto rounded w-100 shadow-lg"
    src="/images/PostmarkDefaultStreams.png"
    style="z-index: 10"
/>
</div>

#### Configuring the Default Inbound Stream
For configuring our inbound emails, we'll be using the _Default Inbound Stream_
option.

After first clicking on the Default Inbound Stream link, you should land on the
'Setup Instructions' page.  Right at the top, you'll see the option to get your
servers inbound email address.

<div class="my-5">
<img
    alt="Postmark Default Inbound Stream Settings"
    class="position-relative mx-auto rounded w-100 shadow-lg"
    src="/images/DefaultInboundStreamSettings.png"
    style="z-index: 10"
/>
</div>

Setting up production email is fraught with peril.  Well...maybe that's being a
_tad_ dramatic but it can still be a bumpy ride.

Debugging and diagnosing production issues with email can feel like trying to look inside a black box
that has another black box inside.  In other words, there's lot of small points
of failure.

For this reason, in order to preserve my time and sanity as best as
possible, I try to do a series of small checks along the way to make sure things
are working as expected.

When I'm trying to resolve production issues, I'll often start with focusing on
things to rule-out to begin with. Performing some small checks along the way can
give you a better idea of what things _are_ working as intended and rule them
out as possible causes.

#### Sending a Test Email

Just to make sure out Inbound Stream has been set up correctly and ready for
use, we can fire off a quick email to the server's inbound email address at the
top-section.  It should look something like this

`123456e8b05e594a3a18129f293281469@inbound.postmarkapp.com`

After sending your inbound email to the server, clicking on the 'Activity' tab
for your inbound server should show the inbound email you just sent.

<div class="my-5">
<img
    alt="Postmark Inbound Server Logs"
    class="position-relative mx-auto rounded w-100 shadow-lg"
    src="/images/PostmarkInbound.png"
    style="z-index: 10"
/>
</div>

This lets us know that things should be configured correctly on the Postmark side and
can move on to the next step.

Speaking of checking things along the way, now would be a good time to make sure
these changes are _deployed_ and checked to make sure the values are set.

#### Checking your credentials

Speaking of checking things along the way, now would be a good time to check if
your changes adding the ingress_password have been deployed to your server.
Missing or incorrect keys is very close to the top of my list for most common
issues when setting up a new service.

A quick visit to our old friend the Rails console is all we need to confirm our
password has been set.

```ruby
Rails.application.credentials.action_mailbox
=> {ingress_password: 12312ddfgdfg}
```

Or if you set the value with an environment variable.

```ruby
ENV["RAILS_INBOUND_EMAIL_PASSWORD"]
=> 12312ddfgdfg
```

#### Add Webhook URL to Postmark

With the password on the server, we need to setup an inbound webhook for
Postmark.  This inbound webhook is going to receive the incoming email and send
the data to our postmark inbound email controller Action Mailbox provides for us.

If you've never seen this syntax for authentication in a URL like this I'm sure this looks
weird but here's how you structure your URL for the webhook to add to Postmark:

`https://actionmailbox:PASSWORD@example.com/rails/action_mailbox/postmark/inbound_emails`

This is using HTTP basic authentication with our username `actionmailbox` and
password `PASSWORD` (the one we generated and added to the credentials) in the
URL.  This is how Rails confirms this is a valid request instead of being an
open endpoint for requests.

The `@example.com` is the URL for our server, as in the URL for where your app
is deployed (not postmark).

The final portion is the route that goes to the Action Mailbox controller for
Postmark.

`rails/action_mailbox/postmark/inbound_emails`

We now have all the info we need to create our inbound webhook URL.

Click on the 'Default Inbound Stream' for your server and look for the section
'Set your server's inbound webhook URL'

<div class="my-5">
<img
    alt="Postmark Inbound Empty Webhook URL"
    class="position-relative mx-auto rounded w-100 shadow-lg"
    src="/images/PostmarkInboundWebhookBlank.png"
    style="z-index: 10"
/>
</div>

You _could_ set up the inbound webhook URL on the 'Setup Instructions' page for
the Inbound Stream, but there's 1 small change we need to make that's not
visible on that page.

There's a helpful little note in the Rails guides about including raw email
content in the payload.

<blockquote>
    <cite>
        <strong>When configuring your Postmark inbound webhook, be sure to check the box labeled "Include raw email content in JSON payload". Action Mailbox needs the raw email content to work.</strong>
    </cite>
</blockquote>

If you navigate to the 'Settings' section for your Inbound Stream, you'll see a
checkbox in the Webhook section that says 'Include raw email content in JSON
payload'

<div class="my-5">
<img
    alt="Postmark Webhook URL JSON Payload"
    class="position-relative mx-auto rounded w-100 shadow-lg"
    src="/images/PostmarkWebhookJSON.png"
    style="z-index: 10"
/>
</div>

That's what the Rails guides were referring to so make sure that option is
checked.

With that option checked, add your webhook URL (`https://actionmailbox:PASSWORD@example.com/rails/action_mailbox/postmark/inbound_emails`) to the field.

Now we're added new configs, it would be a good time to confirm they're working.

**Testing The Webhook URL**

After saving your Inbound webhook URL, you should see a button to check the URL confirming Postmark can correctly send
requests to your sever.  Clicking on the button should show a loading state and if everything goes well, you'll see:

`Remote server returned an HTTP status code of 204`

<div class="my-5">
<img
    alt="Postmark Webhook URL Success"
    class="position-relative mx-auto rounded w-100 shadow-lg"
    src="/images/PostmarkWebhookSuccess.png"
    style="z-index: 10"
/>
</div>

If you're not seeing that, you know that there's an issue connecting your Rails
app and Postmark so gives you a good idea of where to look too (check your rails
logs to see if the request is hitting your server and if so, if there's anything
obvious happening)

Seeing a successful request doesn't necessarily mean everything is ready to go,
just that Postmark is connecting with your app at the correct URL.  This request
should be visible in your server logs as well.

If your request fails, you'll see an error message.

<div class="my-5">
<img
    alt="Postmark Webhook URL Error"
    class="position-relative mx-auto rounded w-100 shadow-lg"
    src="/images/PostmarkWebhookError.png"
    style="z-index: 10"
/>
</div>

If you're not getting a successful request to your webhook URL, checking your logs to see if the request
hit your app and any errors that may have been raised afterwards is the first
place to look.

#### Connecting a Domain
If you'd like to connect a domain you have to handle all your inbound mailers
(hot tip: subdomains save a ton of headache) you can read more about that
[here](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/user-guide/inbound/inbound-domain-forwarding
){:target="_blank"}


The short version is you need to create a MX record for your inbound email
domain and set the value to `inbound.postmarkapp.com`

If I wanted to set up something like `inbound.example.com` as my inbound email
URL, I would create a new DNS record, set the type to MX, add `inbound` in the
Name section, set the priority 10 (from their docs) and the value to
`inbound.postmark.com`

<div class="my-5">
<img
    alt="Postmark Webhook DNS Settings"
    class="position-relative mx-auto rounded w-100 shadow-lg"
    src="/images/PostmarkDNS.png"
    style="z-index: 10"
/>
</div>

The screenshot illustrates adding the DNS record for `example.yourdomain.com`

After adding your DNS record, head back to the Inbound Stream settings page and
add your inbound domain to the 'Inbound domain forwarding' section and click
'Save Changes'

And Voila, now you have a production setup for your inbound email.

#### Testing and debugging locally

It's pretty likely that at some point, you'll have some issues you'd like to try
to diagnose or re-create in your local environment.

Using ngrok or cloudflare's secure tunnel service exposes your local development
environment (localhost:3000) to a public URL.  This is great for sending
webhooks from a 3rd party service to your local environment.

Using a secure tunnel service like ngrok or cloudflare exposes your local
environment (localhost:3000) to a public URL.  This is a great way to test
webhooks from 3rd party services to your local environment.

I'll be covering how to use a secure tunnel to debug mailer issues with
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/){:target="_blank}.

Start ngrok with `ngrok http 3000`.  In this case our local Rails app is running
on `localhost:3000`.

Your screen should look something like this.  Note the URL ngrok is making your
app available on.  There's one change we'll need to make to access our running
app on this public URL.

<div class="my-5">
<img
    alt="Example Ngrok Screen"
    class="position-relative mx-auto rounded w-100 shadow-lg"
    src="/images/NgrokScreen.png"
    style="z-index: 10"
/>
</div>

There are a couple of different variations of the ngrok URL (.io, .app, etc.) so
make note of which one is being used.

We need to whitelist this host in our `config/environments/development.rb` file
to tell Rails it's ok to accept connections from this URL.

You can add your specific ngrok domain with: `config.hosts << "f515c7854739.ngrok.app"`

_or_ if you would like to allow **any domain** to access localhost you set hosts
to `nil` with `config.hosts = nil`.  This can be handy when testing multi-tenant
apps.

Without a premium ngrok account, your URL will be different each
time.  If you don't want to update that URL each time you start ngrok, you can
use a regex to whitelist _any ngrok domain.

```
 # config/environments/development.rb
  # whitelist ngrok domains.
  config.hosts << /[a-z0-9-]+\.ngrok\.app/
```

The other change for allowing Postmark to send email to your local environment
is setting the ingress value in `config/environments/development.rb`.

```
# config/environments/development.rb
  # use ngrok and update postmark settings to test locally
  config.action_mailbox.ingress = :postmark
```

Re-start your server, paste your ngrok URL into your browser and make
sure your app loads.

#### Update Postmark Settings for development

Swap your domain name for the ngrok domain in the webhook settings, it should
look something like this:

`https://actionmailbox:PASSWORD@f515c7854739.ngrok.app/rails/action_mailbox/postmark/inbound_emails`

where `f515c7854739.ngrok.app` is the URL sending traffic to my local environment.

If we hit the 'Check' button, even without saving, that should check the URL to
make sure it's working.  You should see a request from Postmark hit your local
environment a couple seconds after clicking the button.  If all goes well,
you'll see the green text saying Postmark received a 204 status code.

If it failed, hopefully it made it to your app and you'll have more information
in your local logs. If you don't see anything in your Rails server logs, it's
most likely an issue with the webhook URL.

If your webhook URL returned an successful response, sending an email to the
inbound email address for the Default Inbound Stream
(`123456e8b05e594a3a18129f293281469@inbound.postmarkapp.com`) should forward
that email to your local Rails app.

To confirm the email made it to Postmark, click on the 'Activity' section for
the Default Inbound Stream and look for the email you just sent.  The email
should have a status like queued, retry or processed.

If everything is configured correctly, you should see some activity in your
local server logs from Postmark at the corresponding controller:

`Processing by
ActionMailbox::Ingresses::Postmark::InboundEmailsController#create as JSON`

Now we have these real emails being forwarded from Postmark to our local dev
environment. This is a huge boost to your feedback loop and a great way to debug
tough to re-create issues with inbound email.

Since this works more or less in the same manner as sending an email from the
Rails Conductor, we can also do things like adding `debugger` to our `process`
method inside a mailbox to access an interactive debugger with the data from the
real inbound email.

Josh Smith has a great article walking through [connecting a debugger to a Rails
application](https://dev.to/joshdevhub/connecting-debugger-to-rails-applications-2p4p){:target="_blank"} if you're not familiar with that process.

Thanks Josh!

#### Using Raw Source in development

If you're unable or unwilling to get everything working with forwarding your
emails to your local environment, you still have some options.

If you click on one of the inbound emails listed in your 'Activity' section of
the Default Inbound Stream, you'll see some additional information about the
inbound email.

Clicking on the tab that says 'Raw Source' will display the source code of the
email.  If you remember from earlier, the Rails Conductor has the option to send
an inbound email using the email source code.  That's the information contained
in this 'Raw Source' section.

Copying that Raw Source and pasting that info into the input for the email by
source option in the Rails Conductor should give you a pretty similar result.

Hopefully this gives you some additional tools and methods for debugging and
inspecting your inbound emails.

#### Final Thoughts

While these steps have been specific for Postmark, a lot of the same principles,
including using a local tunnel like ngrok to send email to your local
environment should be pretty similar.

Please let me know if you feel like I left anything out or when Postmark changes
their UI making all of these screenshots and steps outdated.
