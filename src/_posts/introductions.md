Hello everyone!  I started this blog to chronicle my journey through the Coding Dojo bootcamp in Mountain View, CA this summer.  First things first, a bit of background about myself.<!--more-->

If you haven’t already guessed by the web address, my name is Cody.  I’ve been living in Philadelphia for the past 4 years, but I’m originally from North Carolina.  For the most part, I really enjoy living in Philly except for the fact that everything that should be on a biscuit, is on a bagel but hey…no one is perfect.

My background is primarily in economics and finance and spent the past few years as a loan officer for a mortgage lender.  I know what you’re thinking, why would anyone want to leave the glamorous, exciting, rock star life of a loan officer?  Well, there were some things I really did enjoy about my job, mainly helping people who were severely  underwater on their homes.  Everything else was filled with red-tape and regulations which was the main reason I decided to leave to focus all my efforts on web development and programming.

I fly out to the west coast on Friday and the bootcamp starts on Monday.  I’ll go into more detail on the application process and some of the preparation I’ve done in a later post.
