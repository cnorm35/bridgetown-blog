excerpt: "Hello all!  My last post was on a different blog and a few months back. I decided to set up a new blog once I came across the [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) blogging framework.  It's billed as 'A blogging framework for hackers' making it much easier to share code snippets.  It's also built in Ruby so it seemed like a great project for me to tinker with.
This will be a place where I can share what I'm working on, tips and tricks I
pick up, and the occasional rant."

Hello all!  My last post was on a different blog and a few months back. I decided to set up a new blog once I came across the [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) blogging framework.  It's billed as "A blogging framework for hackers" making it much easier to share code snippets.  It's also built in Ruby so it seemed like a great project for me to tinker with.
This will be a place where I can share what I'm working on, tips and tricks I pick up, and the occasional rant.

So... on the last update, I had just started working on SQL queries at the [Coding Dojo](http://www.codingdojo.com) bootcamp.  Shortly after that, we began our PHP section of the bootcamp.  When we finally started working on programming instead of just HTML and CSS, I didn't look back.  The next 2 months or so, I tried to cram as much coding as I could into a day.  That was the main reason I wasn't able to keep up with my posts as much as I would have liked.  I'll going into a lot more detail about the bootcamp experience in a later post.  For now, I just wanted to catch things up.  My 3 months in Silicon Valley we great, but I ended up leaving about a week early.  It wasn't for any bad reason though, quite the contrary.  I was leaving early because I got an offer to start working as a Ruby on Rails developer at [Bestimators](http://bestimators.com) back in Philadelphia.  The company was about to start a 3 month program with [Dreamit Ventures](http://www.dreamitventures.com/).  Dreamit is one of the top startup accelerators around with offices in New York, Austin, Israel, Baltimore, and Philadelphia.  Leaving the bootcamp a week early meant I had to miss out on presenting a final project at the Coding Dojo's demo day.  Today is the payback.  As I'm writing this, the demo day for Dreamit Philly's class of 2014 is in about 3 hours.  

Once demo day is wrapped up, and thing have settled down a bit, I'll talk about what it was like going from a coding bootcamp directly into a startup incubator for 3 months.

For now, thank you so much for cheking out the new blog and please feel free to ask me any questions you might have about switching careers, becoming a software developer, working at an early stage startup, or what it's like to go through a start up accelerator.
