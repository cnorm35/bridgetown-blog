<!-- People are stil talking about eras right? -->

### Have you ever seen a Purple Cow?

First things first, I should probably fill those of your who may be unaware
of the Purple Cow concept. Seth Godin has an [entire book](https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Cow-New-Transform-Remarkable/dp/1591843170) that does a great job of
going into more detail around this concept.

<!-- The idea is if you're driving along the road and you see a cow, you probably -->
<!-- wouldn't havbe much of a reaction. However, if you saw a purple cow, now that's a head turner. -->
The short version...


_Be Remarkable._


Remarkable is necessarily describing quality or that something is good.  It's
more about that it's interesting, unique, delightful or weird.  So much so, you
just have to tell people about it (remark).

In this context, _Remarkable_ isn't necessarily saying something is good, just
that it's worthy of remarking on.

<!-- This is just a small snippet of all the great info in the book and I highly -->
<!-- recommend if it sounds like something you're interested in. -->


### What do I _do_?

Almost one year into my most recent foray into the land of self-employment, I've
been thinking more about more long terms goals and my overall vision.

The past few months, I've had a chance to work on a few different types of
projects and ventures.  I've also had some trouble articulating what it is I
do...

The easiest title and the one I use most frequently is "Independent Rails
Consultant".  This accounts for the lion's share of my time and income so that's the one I usually lead with.

But it's not the only thing I do.  One of the main reasons for going
self-employed was having more time to work on other projects and ventures.

Some of those have been:

- Blogging
- Mentoring Early Career Developers
- Offering Developer Coaching Services and Packages
- Spot Squid (SaaS)
- Speaking at meetups and conferences
- Potentially launcing a ruby retreat?
- Early stages for course. (fix this one)


<!-- It's been great to have the urge to work on this many different things.  But I -->
<!-- wouldn't use describe what I do. -->

The variety and breadth of these projects has been a huge jolt for my
creativity.  These projects have been stretching me to the edge of my comfort
zone in a lot of areas.  That's always been a good metric that I'm heading in
the right direction.

With all these different projects, I wouldn't use writer, speaker,saas founder, conference organizer or developer coach to describe what I do.

<!-- I've been pretty careful not to spread myself too thin and burn out.  I think -->
<!-- one of the reasons for the breadth of the projects is that they're stirring up -->
<!-- all my creative juices in a way I just have to get them out of my head. -->

<!-- Focus and consistency are two areas I've always had trouble with.  I've made -->
<!-- some great strides in the past couple of years and would always feel a twinge of -->
<!-- self-inflicted guilt for not focusing on the 'one thing'.  And still do. -->
Focus and consistency are two areas I've always had trouble with.  I've made
some great strides in the past couple of years and would always feel a twinge of
self-inflicted guilt for not focusing on the 'one thing'.

### Dawn of the Purple Cow Era

_How does all of this Purple Cow relate to me?_

<!-- What's this dawning of the purple cow era? -->

My Purple Cow Era is about chasing down the ideas that I'm interested in and
excite me.  These are the types or projects where ideas just seem pour out of
me.  That's always a good sign I should keep things going.  Very much in the way
of Derek Sivers and [Hell Yeah or No](https://sive.rs/n), when you get these ideas let them play
out for a bit.

Working on these different projects and ideas are the easiest way for me to put
my own unique stamp and feel to the thigns I'm working on.

The idea of The Purple Cow era also feels like it's unblocked a ton of mental
bottlenecks.
Now I don't have to feel like I have to try to find which box I fit into.  My
box is a pasture and I'm just out here grazin'

### Let it Rip

There's a saying you may have heard...

<blockquote>
    <cite>
      <strong>I'm here for a good time, not a long time.</strong>
    </cite>
</blockquote>

If you've heard this, it was probably right before someone did something really
stupid.

Instead of viewing this in the light of reckless abonment, I think about it more
like a reminder we should all relish what little time we have.

In the grand scheme of things, none of us are here for a long time so we
shouldn't forget to have a good time along the way.

Changing my internal mandate to something along the lines of:

_Do and make interesting, unique and remarkable things that are good expressions
of you._

Really makes it feel like I've cleared a path to follow more of these ideas and
also have the chance to chase down those Hell Yeah ideas that come my way.

<!-- I don't think anyone is laying on their deathbed thinking... -->

<!-- Gee, I wish I --> 

<!-- Cut it, print it. Get it lazer printed on one of those wooden plaques. -->

<!-- Mooo-ve over for the Purple Cow to make it's way into your work. -->
