<!-- People are stil talking about eras right? -->

So first things first, I should probably fill those of your who may be unaware
of the Purple Cow concept.

Seth Godin has an entire book covering this subject that does a great job of
going into more detail around this concept.

The idea is if you're driving along the road and you see a cow, you probably
wouldn't havbe much of a reaction.

However, if you saw a purple cow, now that's a head turner.

The short version...


Be Remarkable.


Remarkable is necessarily describing quality or that something is good.  It's
more about that it's interesting, unique, delightful or weird.  So much so, you
just have to tell people about it (remark).

This is just a small snippet of all the great info in the book and I highly
recommend if it sounds like something you're interested in.

So how does all this relate to me?  What's this dawning of the purple cow era?

Almost one year into my most recent foray into the land of self-employment, I've
been to think more about more long terms goals and what's my overall vision.

The past few months, I've had a chance to work on a few different types of
projects and ventures.  I've also had some trouble articulating what it is I
do...

The easiest one and the one I use most frequently is "Independent Rails
Consultant"  This accounts for the lion's share of my time and income.  But it's
not the only thing I do.  One of the main reasons for moving to self-employment
was having more time to work on other projects and ventures.

Some of those have been:

- Blogging
- Mentoring Early Career Developers
- Launched Developer Coaching Services and Packages
- Spot Squid (SaaS)
- Public speaking at meetups and conferences
- Potentially launcing a ruby retreat.
- Early stages for course.


It's been great to have the urge to work on this many different things.  But I
wouldn't use writer, saas founder, conference organizer or developer coach to
describe what I do.

Focus and consistency are two areas I've always had trouble with.  I've made
some great strides in the past couple of years and would always feel a twinge of
self-inflicted guilt for not focusing on the 'one thing'.  And still do.


I've been pretty careful not to spread myself too thin and burn out.  I think
one of the reasons for the breadth of the projects is that they're stirring up
all my creative juices in a way I just have to get them out of my head.


There's a saying you may have heard.

> I'm here for a good time, not a long time.

If you've heard this, it was probably right before someone did something really
stupid.

Instead of viewing this in the light of reckless abonment, I think about it more
like a reminder we should all relish what little time we have.

In the grand scheme of things, none of us are here for a long time so we
shouldn't forget to have a good time along the way.

My Purple Cow Era is about chasing down the ideas that I'm interested in and
excite me.  These are the types or projects where ideas just seem pour out of
me.  That's always a good sign I should keep things going.  Very much in the way
of Derek Sivers and "Hell Yeah or No", when you get these ideas let them play
out for a bit.

Working on these different projects and ideas are the easiest way for me to put
my own unique stamp and feel to the thigns I'm working on.  

The idea of The Purple Cow era also feels like it's unblocked a ton of mental
bottlenecks.

Now I don't have to feel like I have to try to find which box I fit into.  My
box is a pasture and I'm just out here grazin'

But seriously, changing my internal mandate to:

Do and make interesting, unique and remarkable things that are good expressions
of you.

<!-- I don't think anyone is laying on their deathbed thinking... -->

<!-- Gee, I wish I --> 

Cut it, print it. Get it lazer printed on one of those wooden plaques.

Mooo-ve over for the Purple Cow to make it's way into your work.
