COPIED OVER FROM OLD POST

I thought about re-creating Kramer's inept and short-lived movie phone from
Seinfield.

CLIP HERE IF POSSIBLE

For some reason, that cracked me up and thought it would be a cool proof of
concept with relativly little code.

I started on that and started a new blog post to go with it.  Sometime in the
first day or so of working on it, I had the thought that Halloween is a few
months away and maybe could do horror movies in Oct.  For a little bit of
background, I love movies and have been hoarding movies ever since college.  I
especially love horror movies so thought that would be really fun.

I made a note of it and carried on for a bit and at some point, said to myself
"Screaming Recommendations" instead of "Sreaming Recommendations"  Decided to
check to see if the domain was available and was really excited to see it was
available.  It doesn't take much for me to buy a domain name and this was no
exception.

After getting the domain, I fired up a fresh rails app and was on my way.
I wanted to create a phone line that you could call in, get a couple prompts for
different services, make a choice and get some recommendations on the most
popular horror movies for streaming.  I wanted something weird, fun, and
moderately useful (debatable).  Think a cross between a late night public access
horror show and a moviephone.  

I remember getting recommendations on great stuff from people working at the
video store and thought this was a cool throwback to that.  It's not there yet,
a not doing any AI or machine learning, just returning popular results but think
it would be easy to improve the recommendaitons with some more work.


The voice was fine, but was not putting out what I would call a spooky vibe so
thought about some possible solutions.  Turns out, Fiverr has some great options
for getting voice over work done so found someone to do an intro i could play at
the start of the call.
