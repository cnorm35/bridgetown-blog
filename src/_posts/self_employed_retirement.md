I've always had an interest in personal finance but that's something I got
really interested in during my time as a mortgage loan officer.

I spent a few years talking to hundreds of people about their finances and
reviewing their credit reports.  There was also an opportunity to start working
as a financial advisor but passed so I could focus on learning to code and power
through with my career switch.
