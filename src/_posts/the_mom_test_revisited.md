parts of my customer journey was great"

Not long ago, a friend and former co-worker connected me with a tattoo shop
owner who is pretty tech-forward and was interested in hearing more about what
I've been working on with Spot Squid.

Cold outreach to tattoo artists for Spot Squid has proved difficult. 
The artists I think this is the best fit for are precisely the ones that will
have the most spam and noise in their inbox.  In a sea of people waving fists full
of cash at them to book an appointment, my emails aren't very enticing. A number
of these tattooers also have assistants that handle all their booking so it's
likely a large chunk of my cold outreach is never making it past the first
gatekeeper.

After sending a demo of what I've been working on, I was able to get some time
booked to get some feedback and ask some questions. That was a _big_ win. 
In addition to feedback on the app, the process, and his overall thoughts, I knew
I would have a rare chance to get detailed information on the habits and pain
points of my potential customers.

In other words, I didn't want to blow a golden opportunity. I first read _The Mom Test_ about a year ago when I was at a much different stage in my building. 
I knew it was a pretty quick read and packed with useful information.  Within 20 minutes of getting the email agreeing to talk, I was off and running.

I've recommended this book so many times but still am surprised and how clear,
concise, and impactful all the points are.  There's nothing in there that doesn't
need to be. I even bought the author's other book about _writng useful_ books
because I wanted to learn some of the spells he cast.

<!-- Being further along in my journey and not starting completely from scratch I was -->
<!-- great to see some of the examples were really close to some of the situations -->
<!-- I've been experiencing as well. -->

After having done some actual customer development talking to living and
breathing people since my initial read, I was able to see examples in the book
that were similar to the situations I had experienced.  That was reassuring
and felt like I was on the right track and in the right place to hone my
customer development skills.

Scattered throughout the book are _Rules of Thumb_ (Is that the correct plural? it can't be
_Rule of Thumbs_ right?).

I'd like to highlight a few that were the most impactful for me, at least right
now.  It was hard to whittle down my list, but this is what I ended up with.
<!-- I'm going to talk about -->
<!-- some of the most impactful for me, right now.  I think this would be a good -->
<!-- exercise to do again down the line and see how my answers may have changed. -->

### Customer conversations are bad by default

I would say I would have this one on the top of my list after my first read. 
I don't think I realized just how _bad_ I was doing customer conversations.
It's like realizing you've been calling someone the wrong name all night, you
feel like an idiot and wish you could just turn back the clock.

Well, better late than never. It was good to hear that and while I like to _think_
I've gotten much better, I think just knowing that you're probably not doing
nearly as well as you think you are is an important reminder.

It's not your fault. People want to be nice and support others. Without
digging into some responses and getting at the root of the issue, you probably
won't unearth the truth.

### Ideas and feature requests should be understood, but not obeyed.

This one is important to me because since I'm the one building all the features, sometimes my otherwise perfectly
reasonable judgment can be swayed by something that sounds fun.  Don't tempt me
with a good time.

Understanding where this request is coming from is the real goal.  What's their
end goal? What's the pain point they're trying to solve?

### Watching someone do a task will show you where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are.

A picture is worth a thousand words and a screen recording is 10x that. 
I'm sure you have a calculator on your phone so you can do that math.
If your goal is to _understand_ the request instead of implementing it, this is a
great way to do that. Ideally, being in person and watching someone perform
their task in the same environment they do it in, you'll probably see the best
results.

However, even if you're not able to be face-to-face with your customers, there are still a lot of options
for finding these friction points they have.

A few screen recordings of your potential customers walking through their task
can go a long way in eliminating guesswork for where potential friction or
painpoints are in the process.

### The more you’re talking, the worse you’re doing

*gavel slams* **guilty as charged**

I am just thrilled to be in a position to even talk about something I've enjoyed building and have high hopes for. 
When I have potential customers talking with me and giving me feedback for _free_?  Don't get me
started. I usually have to book appointments and spend a couple hours with a
captive audience to get that kind of face time.

Being excitable is ok and your passion came come through with how you're talking
about your product and experiences.  Just remember to pump the brakes
occasionally.

### You always need a list of your big 3 questions

This is a rule that made it feel like I had reached a different stage in my
customer development journey. On my first read, I
had a _massive_ list of potential questions and hadn't begun the process of
narrowing those down.  This time, I'm still working on locking down what
those 3 are, but it's a much shorter and more focused list.

Another thing the author mentions is to have your 3 questions for _different types_ of people you may want to get
feedback or advice from. This was another _huge_ takeaway for me.

Rails Conf in Atlanta was the first time I was able to talk about Spot Squid
after I pushed it out of the nest.  When I was at Rails SaaS in October, I had
_just_ started talking about Spot Squid and the work I had been doing.  It wasn't
quite ready at the time but would go live about a month later.

The feedback and advice that I've received has absolutely sold me on the intangible value of
conferences. Having my 3 questions for _non-potential customers_ isn't something
I had considered before but is definitely something I'm going to think about.
He mentions having these ready to take advantage of those serendipitous
opportunities and this is a great way to put that into action.

Revisiting _The Mom Test_ and seeing things in a new light now that I have a little more experience was a great exercise. Re-reads are
always fascinating to me to see what jumps out that you may have missed on the
first read.

I've been getting some great recommendations on more books around
customer development to my reading list so send me your recommendations!
