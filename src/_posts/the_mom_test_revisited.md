excerpt: "Re-reads always surface new information but re-reading at different
parts of my customer journey was great"

Recently, through a friend, I got an introduction to a potential customer who is
pretty much exactly, if not better, that what I wrote out as who I thought my
ideal customer would be.

Cold outreach to tattoo artists for Spot Squid has proved difficult.  In fact,
the artists I think this is the best fit for are precicely the ones that will
have most spam and noise in their inbox.

<!-- I got an email connecting the two of us the day before leaving for Rails conf, -->
<!-- that was part of the wave of good luck that I seemed to manifest with a little -->
<!-- persistance and a tattoo [link post] -->

<!-- I received some really amazing advice at Rails conf about Spot Squid.  I had -->
<!-- finally worked up the courage to start talking about what I was working on last -->
<!-- year at Rails SaaS and was able to finally launch the first version of Spot -->
<!-- Squid a few weeks after the conference. -->

<!-- This was the first time I was at a conference with my own startup's problems to -->
<!-- solve and customers to find.  Just talking to people about what I was working -->
<!-- on and some of the interesting situations I've found myself while getting -->
<!-- feedback for an i -->
<!-- This was the first time I was at a confernce with my own startup's problems to -->
<!-- solve and customers to find.  I got some great advice from people's who's -->
<!-- opinions I really admire. -->

<!-- Some of the more interesting conversatsions were around sales. -->

<!-- Believe it or not, in a former life, I was selling mortages on the phone 5-6 -->
<!-- days a week.  Making 100 calls a day and hearing 'No' as one of the more polite -->
<!-- things during my day, I was ready to get hurt again. -->

<!-- I decided instead of telling this potential evangalist customer what I could do -->
<!-- for them, I decided to show them. -->  

<!-- (Talk about demo and customizations) -->


After sending a demo of what I've been working on, I was able to get some time
booked for the following week. That was a big win, I would say the potential
customer is exactly what I wrote out would be an ideal avatar and someone that
could potential be a partner or evangalist.

In other words, I didn't want to mess it up so decided to do a re-read of The
Mom Test.

I've recommend this book so many times but still am surprised and how clear,
concise and impactful all the points are.  There's nothing in there that doesn't
need to be.  In fact, I even bought Rob's other book about _writng useful_ books
becuse I wanted to learn some of the spells he cast.

One thing that was very interesting is I'm in a much different place with the
same product reading this. I was able to see some specific examples that were a
really close analog to situations I'be been experiencing as well.

Scattered throughout the book are _Rules of Thumb_.  I'm going to talk about
some of the most impactful for me, right now.  I think this would be a good
exercise to do again down the line and see how my answers may have changed.

### Customer conversation are bad by default

This is probably one that I would say I would have in my top list on my first
read too.  I don't think I realized how bad I was doing customer conversations.
It's like realizing you've been calling someone the wrong name all night, you
feel like an idiot and wish you could just turn back the clock.

But better late than never, it was good to hear that and while I like to _think_
I've gotten much better, I think just knowing that you're probably not doing
nearly as well as you think you are is an important reminder.

It's not your fault.  People want to be nice and support others so without
digging into some responses and getting at the root of the issue, you proably
wont unearth the truth.

<!-- People stop lying when you ask them for money -->

### Ideas and feature requests should be understood, but not obeyed.

I really liked this one because since
I'm the one building all the features, sometime my otherwise perfectly
reasonable judgment can be swayed by something that sounds fun.  Don't tempt me
with a good time.

Understanding where this request is coming from is the real goal.  What's their
end-goal or pain point their trying to solve?

### Watching someone do a task will show you where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are.

This one piggybacks on the one above.
A picture is worth a thosand words and a screen recording is 10x that.  
If your goal is to _understand_ the request instead of implement it, this is a
great way to do that.
Even if you're not able to be face to face with people, there are stil a lot of options
for finding these friction points your customers have.

### The more you’re talking, the worse you’re doing

*gavel slams* guilty


Look, I am just thrilled to be in a position to even talk about something I've
really enjoyed building and have high hopes for.  When I have potential
customers talking with me and giving me feedback for _free_?  Don't get me
started, I usually have to book appointments and spend a couple hours with a
capitve audince to get that kind of face time so it's exciting to get to the
next step.

You always need a list of your big 3 questions (for each type of person, see below)

This was probably the pinnacle of being in my new stage.  On my first read, I
had a massive list of potential questions and hadn't really began the process of
narrowing those down.  This time, I'm still working on my 3 but I'm much closer
and have really started thinking about this.  

He also mentions to have your 3 questions for _different types_ of people to get
feedback from. This was another _huge_ takeaway for me.

RailsConf in Atlanta was the first time I was able to talk about Spot Squid
after it had been live for a bit.  When I was at Rails SaaS in October, I had
just started talking about Spot Squid and what I'd been working on.  It wasn't
quite live yet, but would go live about a month later.

The feedback and advice that I got has really sold me on the intangible value of
conferences. Having my 3 questions for _non potential customers_ isn't something
I had considered before, but is defintely something I'm going to think about.
He mentions having these ready to take advantage of those serendipitious
opportunities and this is a great way to put that into action.


It was a great exercise going back through The Mom Test and seeing things in a
new light being that I'm in a new stage in my business.  I'm always a fan of
re-reads and looking to dive into some more recommend titles on customer
development.
