### The Road To Rails Conf
Last week, I had a chance to give my first conference talk at what turned out to
be the penultimate Rails Conf.

(That was the culmination of about 18 months of work trying to speak at a
conference.)

Sometime early last year, I decided I was really going to start working on doing
more public speaking and had the goal of being accepted to speak at a
conference.

I put a lot of work into my first proposal but wasn't selected.  Honestly, that
may have been for the best.

I don't consider myself a sore loser.  If I didn't get picked or make the cut for for something, it's because I didn't do a good enough job, plain and simple. That doesn't mean I'm happy about it, but I'm fine with losing.  I guess a good way to put this is I'm fine with losing, but I _hate_ the feeling, especially when it's something I've set my mind to.

<!-- (talk about hating losing) -->

Getting that first stinging rejection let me know I had to set my game up.  I
started reading any article I could find on how to prepare a good conference
proposal.  Here are some of the resources that were a big help for me (list out
and thank everyone)

Another great resource I found was [Speakerline.io](https://speakerline.io/){:target="_blank"}

### What does a good proposal even look like?

During Rafael Franca's keynote at Rails Conf 2023 he mentioned one way he
started getting more comfortable with contributing to Rails was that he started
reading over _every single new commit_.

I loved this and decided to try something similar with conference proposals.  I
read over every single Ruby propsal at least once, some of them multiple times.
I started to get a much better idea of what a good (and accepted) proposal looks
like.

<!-- and felt like I gained a much better idea of how to put together a solid proposal. -->

<!-- Having a much better idea of how to put together a good proposal, I felt much -->
<!-- better prepared and was able to join my first proposal coaching session courtesy -->
<!-- of the fine folks at Ruby Central.  I had a chance to get some great feedback on -->
<!-- my ideas and two proposals while also seeing what some of the other attendees -->
<!-- were working on. -->

<!-- Armed with my newfound knowledge on conference proposals, I felt much more prepared and joined my first proposal coaching session courtesy of the fine folks at Ruby Central.

To round out my newfound knowledge on the proposal process, I also attended my
first proposal coaching session courtesy of the fine folks at Ruby Central.  It
was a great chance to get feedback my ideas and proposals while also seeing what
others were working on.

So...after reading dozens of proposals, getting some coaching on my specific
proposals and submitting to the next conference...

More rejections.

<!-- After a long year, I was starting to wonder if it was something I would contiune -->
<!-- to do.  But after a little rest over the holidays, I reclaimed that spark and -->
<!-- decided I was going to come out swinging in 2024. -->

### Down but not out

After a long year, I began wondering if I should put my talk ambitions on the
back-burner and focus on other areas. I had some time to rest up and lick my
wounds over the holidays and after a bit of recharging, decided I wasn't done
yet and was going to come out swinging in 2024.

Sometime around January or Febuary of this year, I started compiling a list of all the
ruby conferences I could potentially submit to along with the Call For Proposal
dates.

<!-- I also started stockpiling ideas for potential topics. -->

I started writing some blog posts around some of my potential proposal
topics.  This was a big win because the blog content made it much easier to pull
info an ideas from to include in the proposal.  It also gave me a chance to get
feedback on what parts people thought were the most valueable.

<!-- I really went all in on my proposal and had already scheduled two meetups to -->
<!-- speak at with an early version of my talk.  My thinking was... -->
I decided to go all in on what I thought was my strongest proposal and reached
out to Boulder Ruby and speak on that topic (update this).

My thinking was...

If I don't get accepted, having a chance to get some more feedback would improve
my chances in future.

If I _did_ get accepted, I'd already be commited to having an early version done
about 6 weeks before Rails Conf.

Hearing the theme of this year's Rails Conf was 'building with Rails' I had some
ideas for a talk on Action Mailbox that I thought would be a great fit.  I
thought this was my strongest proposal and represented my best chance at being
accepted.

**Thursday 2/29 @ 2:03 PM** (I saved the email) I finally got my breakthrough.

"Holy $hit..."

I had to squint and re-read the email a couple of times but there it was. The
acceptance email I've been on the hunt for so long.

### Knocking the dust off

<!-- I took the rest of the week and weekend to soak it all in and enjoy such a big -->
<!-- milestone for me. But when Monday rolled around, it was time to get to work. -->

I took the rest of the week to take a bit of a victory lap and enjoy hitting
such a big personal milestone.

<!-- When Monday rolled around, it was time to get to work. -->

A funny line I added to my planning notes that Saturday (March 2)

_"What's the Rocky IV equivalent for preparing for a talk?"_

For those unaware, [Rocy IV](https://youtu.be/B_9FyTiq3SA?si=bRlLqS41zAfenxZK)
has the best training montage in existience.  I will not be taking further
questions.

I didn't think I'd be able to realisticly pull that off, but thinking about what
that would look like, gave me some good ideas to think about for prep.

When Monday rolled around, it was time to get to work.

I immediately picked up a couple of Audio Books on speaking and how to craft an
engaging and entertaining presentation.  I also thought that audiobooks might
have the advantage of being able to _hear_ the examples instead of just reading
which I thought would be a big help.

Even though I had never given a conference talk, I thought that depending on
books and recordings alone would be like reading a book on skydiving and
thinking that'll be enough to help me jump out of a plane.

<!-- In other words...practicing was where the majority of my focus should be and -->
<!-- there's absolutely no subsititute for feeling more comfortable speaking in -->
<!-- public than...you guessed it, speaking in public. -->

**March 12 -** I had a chance to speak at the remote Philly rb meetup giving an early
version of the talk.  This was extra special for me since Philly.rb was the
first meetup I ever spoke at and was the last meetup I spoke at in person back
in 2016 before relocating to CO.  I felt like it went really well and was also
lucky enough to get some great feedback and speaker coacking from Kevin Murphy.
After going over some of the things he'd tweak or change, we started riffing on
a couple of 'Big Swing' ideas.  That really set me off on the path to think
about how I could do some fun things to make this talk very 'me'.

**March 13 -** All week I'd been tracking a potentially record breaking blizzard that
was due to hit us in CO right around the time I was supposed to speak at the
Boulder Ruby meetup in person.  My small mountain town is a little over an hour
from Boulder under normal conditions and the last strech requires me heading
through a moutain road that's pretty well known for people getting stranded on.

I don't think I've ever prepped for heading to a meetup by throwing a sleeping
bag and shovel into my card ahead of time but I suppose there's a first time for
everything.  All indicatons were pointing to a rough drive home at a minimum
with a reasonable possibility of being stranded and having to sleep in my car
(this happens a lot in CO).  I knew it would be risky but it also represented my
only chance to speak in person to get some practice and feedback pre-rails conf.
I knew it would be a huge gamble, but if it payed off, would have done 2 version
of my talk with tons of ideas for improvements and 6 weeks to go to Rails Conf.

With no exageration do I tell you I _barely_ made it back.  We ended up with
about 30 inches total with one area I drove through on my way home getting 36
inches in a 24 hour period.

I can't thank the organizers for both meetups enough and very grateful for
having me.

(Include some videos)


### Big Swings

One of the things that was clear from the meetups, people really enjoyed the
examples and had never thought about using Action Mailbox in that way.

I started creating a list of 'practical examples' you can easily add
with Action Mailbox. Since I had a 'practical' example section, I thought it
would be fun to close out with an 'impractical' section.  This would be a
handful of the weirdest, interesting but maybe not useful things built with
Action Mailbox.  I thought this would be a great way to inject some personality
into the talk and also throw out a wide range of things you can do with an
inbound email in hopes people would walk away with their own ideas to add to
their app.

I probably have a whole post's worth of material covering all the stuff that
_didn't_ work or at least became too much to get working on time.

Seriously, the past month, my office has been littered with hotwheels tracks,
springs, button-pushers, mouse traps, skateboard wheels and more. I'm determined
to get at least one of those working to include in any future talks. 

There was just something about the idea of sending an inbound email that triggered stuff
to happen in the real world that cracked me up.

One idea I had was to see if the after market remote start device I had
installed on my truck had an API available.  The device uses LTE to stay
connected and has a moble app that allows you to monitor the status and perform
differnt actions like lock/unlock and start the vehicle.  My top idea soon
became something along the lines of

"I wonder if I could send an inbound email to start my car?"

Unfortunately, there wasn't a public API I could find.  However, I was fortunate
enough to find someone who created an unoffical API wrapper with JS.

After skimming through the repo a bit, it seemed like it was possible and after
getting a token, would be a pretty simple API request I could trigger in the
mailbox.

I had casually floated out this idea a couple of times over the past couple of
months and got some chuckles but it was clear that it would be tough to convey
just how goofy this is through slides. I knew I had to record some kind of video
demoing this for people to really get it.

After a long string of failures earlier in the week, I was able to get this
working while recording the process on Friday afternoon just a couple of days
before traveling for Rails Conf.

On Saturday, I finsihed editing the video and added it to my slides.  I could
not stop laughing when I watched it and was so tempted to share it publicly but
thought if I was able to keep this under wraps, and come out of nowhere with a
video demo of starting an 06 Tacoma with an inbound email and a lil' bit of
Rails code.

My talk was right before lunch and wanted to do something that people would feel
like they just had to ask someone if they saw it or tell them what they just
saw.

After the talk was done and getting to see a room full of people react to it I
decided to post a quick tweet with the video on my my back to the conf venue
after stashing my bag post lunch.

It was viewed over 10,000 times in less than two days.

That was wayyyyyyyy more than anything I expected and was glad to see people
appreicated the whimsy and fun of it all.

### Next steps?

After getting some great feedback from the content in my talk, I have a much
better idea of the topics that will be included in my upcoming video course on
Action Mailbox.  I've almost finalized the outline and am hoping to have
everything complete in early August.
