Today, I had a bit of a realization.  It was something that really made me realize how my mindset is changing.  I was plugging along at the dojo, and looked at the clock.  Something I do dozens of times a day.  The difference was what I thought afterwards.  It was around 3:30 or so and normally, I would be counting down the hours until I could go home and unwind.  Instead of wishing the time would pass faster, I was wishing it would move slower, wishing I could cram more hours into the day.  This is day 8 of the bootcamp and I’m usually there for about 12 hours a day, ride home and try to knock out another 2-3 hours when I get back to the hacker house.  It reminded me a a really good quote/parable about time a manager of mine sent out a while back.  I think it really speaks for itself so i’ll just end with that.  (I tried to find the source of the quote, and the only name I could find attached was Marc Levy)

>Imagine there is a bank account that credits your account each morning with $86,400. It carries over no balance from day to day.
Every evening the bank deletes whatever part of the balance you failed to use during the day. What would you do? Draw out every cent, of course?
Each of us has such a bank. It’s name is TIME.
Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds.
Every night it writes off as lost, whatever of this you have failed to invest to a good purpose.
It carries over no balance. It allows no over draft. Each day it opens a new account for you. Each night it burns the remains of the day.
If you fail to use the day’s deposits, the loss is yours. There is no drawing against “tomorrow.”
You must live in the present on today’s deposits. Invest it so as to get from it the utmost in health, happiness and success!
>The clock is running!! Make the most of today
