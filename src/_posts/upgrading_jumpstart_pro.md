It's something I'm sure most people reading this post is familiar with.  You
started working on your latest idea from an app.  Start out crushing it and
shipping code left and right.  Then...as it tends to do, life gets in the way.

Blowing the dust off your old side project and getting things updated again can
be a pretty daunting task.  There's a point most of us hit where we start
wondering if the ol' _kill it with fire_ method is the best path forward and
start thinking about scrapping what you have and starting over.

I've been there so many times.  I've also been on projects that go so long
without being updated or maintained, it never gets done.

That was something I wanted to avoid with SpotSquid [link] and to try to take a
long term view of things and make sure things never get to the point of no
return.

I have a few processes I've started using to keep my running SaaS app updated as
a solo developer.  I'll be going through how I keep my Jumpstart Pro app updated
while still shipping features and other changes.
