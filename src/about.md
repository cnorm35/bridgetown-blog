Born and raised in North Carolina which is probably why I have serious BBQ opinions.

Spent the first few years of my career post-college working in Philadelphaia, doing mainly retail and consumer lending before my starting a bootcamp in 2014.

Since then, I’ve been doing mostly backend development with Ruby on Rails.

You can read more about my work experience [here](/work).

Most of my experience is with early stage startups both as a full time employee and an independent consultant.

Some of the most enjoyable parts of my job the past few years has been hiring, onboarding and mentoring new developers.  I try to stay actively engaed with mentorship and helping new developers land their first job.

I’ve been living in Colorado for a few years now and had some good times in Denver, but currently living in a small mountain town called Bailey located in Park county (as in South Park). Being a huge South Park fan, I've taken it upon myself to keep my little town's metions in the show up-to-date on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey,_Colorado#In_popular_culture){:target="_blank"}.
