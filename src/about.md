Born and raised in North Carolina which is probably why I have serious BBQ opinions.

Spent the first few years of my career working in Philadelphaia, doing mainly retail and consumer lending before my starting a bootcamp in 2014.

Since then, I’ve been doing mostly backend development with ruby on rails.

Most of my experience is with early stage startups both as a full time employee and contractor.

Some of the most enjoyable parts of my job the past few years has been hiring, onboarding and mentoring new developers.

I’ve been living in Colorado for a few years now and had some good times in Denver, but currently living in a small mountain town called Bailey.

In my free time I like to fly fish, work on perfecting my Carolina Style BBQ and and hunt hard to find whiskey.

If you want to know anything else, just ask!
