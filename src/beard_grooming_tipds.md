Not long ago, I wanted to get some feedback on possible blog post topics
and ideas for conference proposals.

Asking Twitter seemed like a logical place to start so I decided to create a
poll.

[Twitter Poll](https://twitter.com/cnorm35/status/1749923527799509117)

When I created the Twitter poll, I initially only had 3 options. Since it seems
like a lot of people are naturally curious and just want to see the poll
results, I included a fourth option.  "Beard Grooming Tips"

Right now, Beard Grooming Tips is at #2 with 33%.

I don't think Beard tips would be my strongest option for a conference proposal
this year.  However, if you're a conference organizer and need some outside the
box options, you know where to find me.

Oddly enough, laying down some beard facts seems like just the ticket to
easing the friction of getting back to writing.

There are a few stray avatars scattered across the internet of me
completely clean shaven but for the last 10+ years I've been living the beard
life.

As you can see, our arid and cold climates here in Colorado can be rough on your
beard.

Here are my top tips and advice for caring for your Beard (or someone else's
I'm not a Beard Cop)


### Beard Brush

Unfortunately, you're not able to `bundle add beard-brush`.

Well, technically you could, I just don't think it would have the intended
result.

Getting a brush is a worthy investment.  It's worth noting this is different than
a 'comb'.  A brush has groupings of bristles that help your beard a few
different ways. At first glance, it may look like something you might shine your
shoes with.

- It's great for exfoliating skin, especially in the winter time. This is one of
  the best ways to reduce the dreaded itchy beard.

- Helps spread natural and applied oils easier.

- Tames unruly beard hairs.

### Cleaning
There's lots of advice out there about the _best_ way to clean a beard.  I have
no idea what's correct but the main consensus seems to be that you don't want to
strip your beard of all it's natural oils causing dryness in the hair and skin.
I use some diluted Castile soap and try to stay away from using my normal
shampoo.


### Scissors

Get a nice pair of scissors for trimming.  Most beard kits come with those
really small scissors.  I prefer a normal size pair of hair scissors.  I think
the additional length makes it easier to get even lines and shapes.

Peering into a foggy mirror with a pair of fresh scissors at your throat sounds
dangerous when you say it out loud so your mileage may vary.

### Product

This is where things can really go off the rails.  So many different types of
products claiming different benefits it's tough to know where to start.

The only ones I have experience with are Beard Oil, Beard Cream / Balm, and
Beard Wax

**Beard Oil** - Oils for hydrating your hair to keep things healthy. Look for one
that's jojoba oil based.  Most of the time the oil will also be scented.  Sent
can be a crap shoot.  Sometimes they're too overpowering or just are quite
'right'.

**Beard Balms and Cream** - Work along the same lines as the beard oil but the balm
gives your beard a bit of additional volume and is easier to style and shape.

**Beard Wax** - This is something I got in some beard bundle gift a couple of years
ago and have tried a couple of times.  If you have a lot of hair in the
upper-lip area, a bit of wax and brushing can give your mustache area a better
shape and keep your hair from covering your upper lip.  A word of caution, this
stuff really holds once it's worked it.  After applying a bit more than usual
and absent-mindedly twisting at my mustache area throughout the day, I ended up
with a pretty hefty handlebar mustache.  Like I looked like I was going to tie
some damsel in distress to some train tracks and twist away at my well-waxed
beard.


### DIY Beard Oil

My wife is sensitive to a lot of fragrances so being able to adjust that as
needed was a big selling point.  Plus, I was tired of pay $15 - $20 for a bottle
of beard oil only to find I didn't like the scent or something else.  For the
price of 1-2 bottles you can get everything you need to make your own blend and
adjust to your liking.


- **1 ounce jojoba oil**
- **1/4 ounce avocado oil**
- **1/4 ounce almond oil**
- **15 drops Cedarwood essential oil**
- **5 drops Citrus essential oil**

After adding the essential oils, let the mix sit for a day or so before adding
more.  It needs some time to mingle together before you can tell what the final
result will smell like.  If you add too much, just add some more oil to even
things out.

I'd like to say thanks for going on this ridiculous journey with me.  I
thought this was a fun detour into the world of beard fashion and was a great
way to get back to writing.
