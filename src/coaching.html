                  It has been a great experiencing working with Cody as my mentor. Several months ago I wanted to build up my development skills and wanted to start with contributing to open source. Cody helped me in my journey. I knew what project I wanted to work on, but the project just looked like a big mountain of unknown. Cody helped me get started by guiding me on how to navigate an existing code base. Whenever I hit a roadblock I would explain my situation, and not very good I might add, but because of his years of development experience he could draw together what I needed and point me in the right direction every time. What I like about working with Cody is he is knowledgable, but also his teaching style.

                  Working with Cody has been great! I have had the pleasure of working with Cody in a mentor/mentee relationship at the Agency of Learning (AOL). Cody has a wealth of practical knowledge and experience and is very generous in sharing. You can tell he loves it! He is also very supportive and never condescending, pointing you in the right direction to help you find what you are looking for. I would highly recommend working with Cody if you have the chance!
