title: Lessons from Spot Squid

I haven't been sharing or posting much about what I've been working on with Spot
Squid lately but that doesn't mean I haven't been cranking away at things.

I haven't been posting any updates because in the past it's been more trouble
than it's worth. A new post would usually result in a couple of signups from
curious developers.  There's nothing wrong with that and it's something I do
myself all the time Following up with the signpus to see if I could help with
anything ate up my already limited time.

It's the same situation with the landing page.  I haven't made any updates in
about 9 months and it's still pretty low on my priority list.  Reviewing a few
months of analytics, the vast majority of the traffic are tech people instead of
tattoo artists and shop owners.


### Eating the Dog Food

Right now, focusing on finding product market fit and talking to as many users
as possible has been my number one focus.

<!-- The first version of Spot Squid was my first real SaaS launch.  When I first -->
<!-- started working on it, I was still in the haze of the worst case of burnout -->
<!-- I've ever dealt with and --> 

I started working on the first version of Spot Squid during a period where I was
really depressed and burntout.  I wasn't even sure if I wanted to keep working
as a developer.  Having a project of my own that I could pour myself into and
add anything that I wanted was what started pulling me out of my funk. For a
long time, it was closer to my breakable-toy than a SaaS.

That spark that it gave me re-ignighted some stuff in me.  It helped me find my
grit again.

Before getting into development, from around 2010 - 2014 I was a loan officer for a large mortgage
lender.  Working in mortgages a couple years after a huge financial collapse
that was caused by  _checks notes_ mortgage lenders, made a lot of people pretty
much hate me instantly.  The fact I was working in a call-center was a
double-whammy.  I _never_ cold-called anyone and was only reaching out to people
who asked for more information on mortage rates.

That didn't stop people from _absolutely_ unloading on me.  You name it, I've
heard it and probably multiple times.

In that sea of nastiness, I was able to find some people who I connected with
and was able to help out and that helped me push on.  I learned how to sell and I developed thick skin.  

I started thinking that if I could sell 1.4 million dollars of loans in a month
over the phone, I could do anything.  That's what gave me the motive and means
to go to a Bootcamp when they were still really new.

Anyway, the point I'm making is not only was I feeling good about developing
stuff, but I was ready to 'sell' it.  I've never had the chance to sell
anything that I believed in and was a part of so much.
