### Spot Squid

Spot Squid is a software solution for tattoo artists to fill cancellations easier
than ever before with less hassle.  This is a project that started based on some
of my own experiences as a tattoo client and feedback from different tattoo
artists I've received feedback from. Focusing more on the aspects of product and
customer development over just implementing technical features has been a great
learning experience. I've been writing more about my experiences so be sure to
check out the posts tagged with startups if you'd like to know more.

### Screaming Recommendations

The best thing I can say about this project is it's something that I feel is
very 'me'.  Odd, yet practical with a dash of weird.  This is something I made
purely because I wanted it to be a thing. Call or text 3213-HORROR for
recommendations of horror movies available to stream now. If you keep an eye out at the
conferences I attend, they're usually some scattered pins and stickers while
they last.  If you'd like to see what it's all about _without_ racking up any Twilio charges on
my account, you can listen to the intro and error message I had recorded by a professional voice-over
artist below.

### Engineering Mentor with The Agency of Learning

I've been volunteering as a mentor with an organization called [The Agency of
Learning](https://agencyoflearning.com/).  The group's goal is to help prepare developers early in their career
not just land their first gig, but thrive and excel.  One of the interesting
differences is we try to keep everything as close to what you'd experience at a
job as possible.  That includes things like daily standups, grooming and triaging
issues, and pairing sessions.

I'm fortunate to be one of the tech leads overseeing the development for the
conference app built by a team of early career developers for the first ever
Rails World conference in Amsterdam.  You can read more about this project
[here](https://rubyonrails.org/2023/5/30/rails-foundation-and-agency-of-learning-partner-for-event-app){:target="_blank"}.

I've really enjoyed mentoring newer developers and am thankful I can do my part
to help ensure a bright future for the Ruby community.

If you'd like to know more about how you can hire and empower new developers for
your team.  I would love to talk with you.

### Ruby on Rails Consulting

I'm an independent Rails consultant and have been focusing on SaaS
projects using either Jumpstart Pro or Bullet Train. I currently do not have any
availability, but I'd love to hear how I might be able to help you in the
future.  You can reach me for any questions or project inquiries at the link
